### Visualization Development Project

In this project, I developed various visualization techniques to implement eight fundamental interaction methods:
select, explore, reconfigure, encode, abstract, elaborate, filter, and connect. These methods enhance user engagement and facilitate deeper insights into the data. 

- **Select:** Enabled users to choose specific data points or ranges, allowing for focused analysis and comparison.
- **Explore:** Created interactive visualizations that encourage users to navigate through data dimensions, revealing patterns and trends.
- **Reconfigure:** Designed dashboards that allow users to customize layouts and visualization types based on their analytical needs.
- **Encode:** Utilized various encoding techniques (color, size, shape) to represent data attributes effectively, enhancing interpretability.
- **Abstract:** Implemented high-level summaries and overviews, allowing users to grasp complex datasets at a glance.
- **Elaborate:** Provided detailed views and tooltips that offer additional context and insights into selected data points.
- **Filter:** Integrated filtering options that enable users to isolate specific subsets of data for more targeted analysis.
- **Connect:** Developed interconnected visual elements to illustrate relationships between different data points and dimensions, fostering comprehensive analysis.
